# Sigma-Specification

This repository is used to maintain the specification for the Sigma format.

## Version Management

The version number is in the form of 3 digits 'A.B.C':

- 'A' A major version that could break existing converters
- 'B' A minor version with additions or modifications of functionality affecting but not breaking the converters
- 'C' Reorganization of section, addition of examples etc.

## Current Version

The Sigma format specifications are in the file [Sigma_specification](Sigma_specification.md)  

There are 2 other files for the content of some fields:

- [Tags_specification](Tags_specification.md) defines some standardized tags that can be used to categorize Sigma rules.
- [Taxonomy_specification](Taxonomy_specification.md) defines field names and log sources that should be used to ensure sharable rules
 

## Work in Progress

This section lists upcoming developments and changes to the standard.


It is in a process of dictation and feedback.  
It is possible that some are added and then deleted before the finalization of the version.  
Do not hesitate to open a discussion tag "V2" in the title. Example "V2 proposal of new modifier X".
