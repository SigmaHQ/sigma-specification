## Current Version

There are 2 other files for the content of some fields:

- [Tags_specification](Tags_specification.md) efines some standardized tags that can be used to categorize Sigma rules.
- [Taxonomy_specification](Taxonomy_specification.md) defines field names and log sources that should be used to ensure sharable rules
 

## Work in Progress

This section lists upcoming developments and changes to the standard.


It is in a process of dictation and feedback.  
It is possible that some are added and then deleted before the finalization of the version.
