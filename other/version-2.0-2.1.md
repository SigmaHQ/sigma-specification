## Generality

A lot of work has been done on the wording to make it easier to understand.

Some files have been renamed or moved for convenience.

There is now a workflow to check new input:

- Markdown Linter with mdformat
- Markdown invalid link
- json schema formatting with biome
- Json Schema against generic rules
